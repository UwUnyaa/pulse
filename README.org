Works on non-x86 architectures (even ones that don't support disabling CPUs):

Works on WSL2:

This is an attempt to port the pulse utility from BeOS / Haiku to systems
using the Linux kernel.

It's written in C, and GTK+2, which should be the only things it requires to
compile. It's my exercise to get more familiar with C and writing larger
projects in it.

* Features
- Displays usage of each processor separately
- Displays disabled processors correctly
- Allows to disable and enable processors on the fly (only when running as
  root)

* Building
1. ensure a C compiler and GTK+2 headers are installed (pango and cairo should
   be included if it's a new enough version of GTK+2)
2. clone this repository
3. run =make=

This will generate a binary named =pulse=.
